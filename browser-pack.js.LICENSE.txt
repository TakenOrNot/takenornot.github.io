5.	Distribution Platforms

(b)	procure for the User the right to use the Game in accordance with this EULA.

8.	Acknowledgements and warranty limitations
8.1	The User acknowledges that the use of the Game will require computer hardware and software meeting the minimum requirements specified by the Licensor. The User further acknowledges that, as the Game is updated, those requirements may change and, accordingly, the Game may cease to function on the hardware of the User.
8.2	The User acknowledges that complex software is never wholly free from defects, errors and bugs; and the Licensor gives no warranty or representation that the Game will be wholly free from defects, errors and bugs.
8.3	The User acknowledges that complex software is never entirely free from security vulnerabilities; and the Licensor gives no warranty or representation that the Game will be entirely secure.

10.	Termination
10.1	This EULA shall immediately and automatically terminate if the User commits any breach of this EULA.
11.	Effects of termination
11.1	Upon the termination of this EULA, all of the provisions of this EULA shall cease to have effect, save that the following provisions of this EULA shall survive and continue to have effect (in accordance with their express terms or otherwise indefinitely): Clauses 1, 5, 9, 11 and 12.
11.2	Except to the extent that this EULA expressly provides otherwise, the termination of this EULA shall not affect the accrued rights of either party.
11.3	For the avoidance of doubt, all licences granted to the User under this EULA shall terminate upon the termination of this EULA. Accordingly, the User must immediately cease to use the Game and all other works and materials licensed to the User under this EULA upon the termination of this EULA.
11.4	Within 2 days following the date of effective termination of this EULA, the User must irreversibly delete or destroy all copies of the Game and all copies of all other works and materials licensed to the User under this EULA in the possession or control of the User.
12.	General
12.1	No breach of any provision of this EULA shall be waived except with the express written consent of the party not in breach.
12.2	If any provision of this EULA is determined by any court or other competent authority to be unlawful and/or unenforceable, the other provisions of this EULA will continue in effect. If any unlawful and/or unenforceable provision would be lawful or enforceable if part of it were deleted, that part will be deemed to be deleted, and the rest of the provision will continue in effect (unless that would contradict the clear intention of the parties, in which case the entirety of the relevant provision will be deemed to be deleted).
12.3	The Licensor may vary this EULA by giving to the User at least 30 days' prior written notice of the variation or by updating the version of this EULA published on its website. The continued use of the Game by the User following any such variation constitutes the acceptance by the User of that variation. Subject to this, this EULA may only be varied by a written document signed by or on behalf of each of the parties.
12.4	The User hereby agrees that the Licensor may assign the Licensor's contractual rights and obligations under this EULA to any successor to all or a substantial part of the business of the Licensor from time to time - providing that such action does not serve to reduce the guarantees benefiting the User under this EULA. Save to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law, the User must not without the prior written consent of the Licensor assign, transfer or otherwise deal with any of the User's contractual rights or obligations under this EULA.
12.5	This EULA is made for the benefit of the parties, and is not intended to benefit any third party or be enforceable by any third party. The rights of the parties to terminate, rescind, or agree any amendment, waiver, variation or settlement under or relating to this EULA are not subject to the consent of any third party.
12.6	Subject to Clause 9.1, this EULA shall constitute the entire agreement between the parties in relation to the subject matter of this EULA, and shall supersede all previous agreements, arrangements and understandings between the parties in respect of that subject matter.
12.7	This EULA shall be governed by and construed in accordance with French law.
12.8	Subject to any mandatory requirements of applicable law, the courts of France shall have exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate any dispute arising under or in connection with this EULA.
